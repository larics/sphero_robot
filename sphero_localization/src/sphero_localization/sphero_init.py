    """
    ROS node responsible for providing initial Spheros positions.

    OptiTrack system is used to broadcast position of each Sphero. However,
    positions are stored in an unsorted list as it is impossible to label
    OptiTrack markers with IDs. This node starts a procedure to identify each
    Sphero and its initial position. Kalman filter node is later used to
    maintain this "one-on-one" relation and to provide positions. In order to
    identify a Sphero and its initial position, only one position can be present
    in mentioned unsorted list. Identification process consists of turning
    Sphero's LEDs on and off one by one while knowing which Sphero is the
    current one and storing the position in a dictionary.
